# Speed Running Ethereum

I'm [speeding running ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) by [Austin Griffith](https://twitter.com/austingriffith)! 

Here are my notes & key learnings on the way!

## ‚úÖ Challenge 0: üéü Simple NFT Example

**[Demo](https://challenge0-speedrunning.surge.sh/)**,  **[Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1aEda3999686e3933DEf92bF6A87228043985398)**

This challange shows how to deploy a contract, how to upload it to a hosting platform, test it out on the interface and work with burner wallets. You will not be coding ,but its important to give you an idea of how scaffold-eth works & the different components. 

Here are some key learnings:
- Working with IPFS, how it uses hash. Here's a [video on IPFS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uj6uR3fp-U&ab_channel=SimplyExplained)
- ERC721: Minting the NFT & transfer to wallet 
- Verifing a contract on Etherscan
- Notes: you can run **yarn test** for automated testing in speedrun!

Here's my [post](https://eda.hashnode.dev/create-your-own-nft-collection-on-ethereum) I wrote on how to create an NFT Collection 

## ‚úÖ Challenge 1: ü•© Decentralized Staking App

**[Demo](https://challenge1-speedrunning.surge.sh/)**, **[Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1175D26ff811ccCf7FB54CC889295df66876CE8C#code)**

Staking App allows to coordinates economic activity (super power of crypto). It basically 'locks' up your funds for a certain time. You can withdraw or the funds will be used for a certain purpose.  

In Proof of Stake blockchain, you stake so that the blockchain can put these tokens to work. If you stake your crypto it will become part of the process to validate/approve/add to the blockchain, transactions are validated by people who stake the tokens. For more on Staking: [Ethereum Staking](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#stake) and [WhiteBoard Crypto.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ2UZdB07fo&ab_channel=WhiteboardCrypto)

* The tricky part about the challenge is understanding what to build. Here's my design, to get the architecture:
![staking app](./images/staking_app_design.png)
*When the stake period is over, user shouldn't be able to make any actions (it's like game over)*

Here are some key learnings:
- Interacting with user address & balances: solidity practice (more on payable functions, msg.sender, msg.balance)
- Solidity Modifiers (keep track of a state)
- Recap events in soildity (events & emit --> send to the frontend)
- Execute function: need to be run by the user, smart contract does not auto execute 

## ‚úÖ  Challenge 2: üèµ Token Vendor


**[Demo](https://challenge1-speedrunningethereum.surge.sh/)**, **[Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xA966A7776Eb58772dF33C52CA481b6C934A03415#code)**

A token vendor is a place where you can buy and sell tokens. You can buy tokens with ETH, or sell your tokens in exchange for ETH. 

The project uses ERC20 token. Some key learnings:
 -  YourToken.sol inherits this openzepplin contract 
 -  balanceOf allows you to check the balance of the address directly in ERC 20 :-)
 -  ERC 20 has a transfer() function, many of the functions are already there.

Here's my previous [post](https://eda.hashnode.dev/create-your-own-cryptocurrency-token) on ERC20. 

Key learnings from Vendor.sol: 
-  Getting the balance of the contract (address(this).balance)
-  Ownership in contracts (this allows you to verify the actual owner and I think that they can append or something like that to the contract‚Äîneed to verify this)--> Directly use the onlyOwner in your functions
- there are different options you can uses when sending eth: send(), transfer(), and call(). Here's a more info on the [topic](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/send-ether-reentrancy). And a short quote:
'recommended method for sending ether is the verbose: """ (bool sent, bytes memory _data) = msg.sender.call{value:a mount}(""); require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");` """'
(also over [here](https://blockchain-academy.hs-mittweida.de/courses/solidity-coding-beginners-to-intermediate/lessons/solidity-2-sending-ether-receiving-ether-emitting-events/topic/sending-ether-send-vs-transfer-vs-call/) it states that call is the recommended way to send eth)
(I used transfer in my contract after seeing as a common withdrawl pattern over [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/common-patterns.html), however after researching more learned that the call function whould have been a better way) Also on [solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/) mentions to use call for better gas.
- There is an approve pattern for ERC 20. Read more about it [here.](https://docs.ethhub.io/guides/a-straightforward-guide-erc20-tokens/) Basically you need to approve the tokens for transaction before the vendor can buy them back. The user approves that the tokens can go to the vendor. On the UI, you'll need to test with approve before directly selling the tokens back to the vendor. (It's a 2 process step and you need to sign 2 different transactions w/metamask as the user 1. to apporove the selling 2. to actually sell the tokens)
