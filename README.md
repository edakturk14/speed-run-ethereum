# Speed Running Ethereum

I'm [speeding running ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) by [Austin Griffith](https://twitter.com/austingriffith)! Here are my notes and learnings on the way!

----

## ‚úÖ Challenge 0: üéü Simple NFT Example

**[Demo](https://challenge0-speedrunning.surge.sh/)**

- NFT's
- Working with IPFS, how it uses hash. Here's a [video on IPFS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uj6uR3fp-U&ab_channel=SimplyExplained)
- Minting the nft and transfer to wallet 
- Verify a contract 
- Notes: you can run yarn test for automated testing!!

## ‚úÖ Challenge 1: ü•© Decentralized Staking App

**[Demo](https://challenge1-speedrunning.surge.sh/)**

A staking app basically 'locks' up your digital tokens for a certain time. 
You stake because the blockchain puts these tokens to work: Proof of Stake. If you stake your crypto it will become part of the process, transactions are validated by people who stake the tokens. 

For more on Staking: [Ethereum Staking](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#stake) and [WhiteBoard Crypto.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ2UZdB07fo&ab_channel=WhiteboardCrypto)
 
- Interacting with user address and balances: solidity practice (payable, msg.sender, msg.balance)
- Solidity Modifiers
- Recap events in soildity 
- Designing a staking app

- Execute function: need to be run by the user, can not auto execute 

## [In Progress] Challenge 2: üèµ Token Vendor

A token vendor is a place where you can buy and sell tokens. 
- Create your own token 
- Create a place to buy and sell your own token.
